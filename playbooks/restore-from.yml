# This playbook allows you to restore everything in an existing VM to a new VM.
# Steps to get this done:
# 1) add new VM to your inventory, copy the host_vars file from the existing VM
# 2) add restore: True and restore_from: <name_of_vm_to_restore> variables
#     Eg:
#     restore: True
#     restore_from_vm: debian820
#     restore_backup_server: 192.168.131.192
#     restore_archive: 20161129-1841
# 4) run this playbook, make sure to limit the play to just your new VM name
